# Carrying
Functions that carries you towards happier and better code.

## Why?
Because JavaScript (as is at the moment) lacks some great functions built into the language.
A lot of other languages provides similar functions that this library provides.
Mainly functional languages, which this library has taken it's inspiration from. So this is simply a
functional JavaScript library which provides some useful functions that JavaScript currently lacks.

## Installation
```
npm install --save carrying
```
